# Hello, World!

Passionate about transforming creativity into high-quality user experiences. I believe that design, code, and stability are the foundations for building meaningful connections with users.

My academic background in languages, accounting, and economics has not only cultivated my logical thinking and analytical skills but also enhanced my understanding of and sensitivity to business models. I apply these interdisciplinary strengths to software development, focusing on creating solutions that combine technical depth with business value.
